# TBRW - Tree Builder Random Walk

`tbrw` is an R package for simulating the Tree Builder Random Walk, a random walk process that builds its own tree. The package provides functionality such as generating the adjacency list of the tree generated after n steps, keeping track on the distance and the degree of vertices the walker sees as it walks. We recommend using `igraph` to plot the tree
